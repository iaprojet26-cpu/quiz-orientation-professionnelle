# Student CV: Mistakes to Absolutely Avoid

As a student, creating a professional CV can be a challenge. Some mistakes are particularly common and can cause your application to fail before even getting to the interview. Here are the 10 most common mistakes in student CVs and how to avoid them.

## 1. ❌ CV Too Long or Too Short

**The Mistake:** A 3-page CV or a half-page CV only.

**Why It's Problematic:** Recruiters spend an average of 6 seconds on a CV. A CV that's too long discourages them, a CV that's too short doesn't provide enough information.

**✅ The Solution:** A one-page CV is ideal for a student. If you have many experiences, select the most relevant ones for the targeted position.

## 2. ❌ Inappropriate Personal Information

**The Mistake:** Mentioning age, marital status, religion, or irrelevant information.

**Why It's Problematic:** This information can create bias and is not necessary to assess your skills.

**✅ The Solution:** Limit yourself to: name, first name, professional email, phone, LinkedIn (if relevant), and possibly city.

## 3. ❌ Unprofessional Email

**The Mistake:** Using an email like "superman123@email.com" or "girl2000@gmail.com".

**Why It's Problematic:** This gives an unprofessional image and may cast doubt on your seriousness.

**✅ The Solution:** Create a professional email with your first and last name: firstname.lastname@email.com

## 4. ❌ Inappropriate Photo

**The Mistake:** Vacation photo, selfie, group photo, or too casual photo.

**Why It's Problematic:** The photo is the first impression. An unprofessional photo can cause your application to be rejected.

**✅ The Solution:** Use a professional photo, on a neutral background, professionally dressed, with a discreet smile.

## 5. ❌ Lack of Structure and Clarity

**The Mistake:** Disorganized information, multiple fonts, too bright colors, no visual hierarchy.

**Why It's Problematic:** A CV that's difficult to read is quickly set aside.

**✅ The Solution:** Use a clear structure, a professional font (Arial, Calibri, Times New Roman), and sober colors. Our [CV creation tool](/cv) offers 4 professional templates ready to use.

## 6. ❌ Vague and Generic Descriptions

**The Mistake:** "Motivated student seeking an internship" or "Experience in IT".

**Why It's Problematic:** These phrases provide no concrete information about your skills.

**✅ The Solution:** Be specific: "5th year computer engineering student, specialized in web development, with 3 React projects completed and seeking a final year internship in front-end development."

## 7. ❌ Forgetting Job Posting Keywords

**The Mistake:** Sending the same CV for all job postings without adapting it.

**Why It's Problematic:** Recruiters often use sorting software that searches for specific keywords.

**✅ The Solution:** Adapt your CV to each posting by incorporating important keywords from the ad (skills, technologies, sought-after qualities).

## 8. ❌ Neglecting Personal Projects

**The Mistake:** Not mentioning your projects, even if they're not professional.

**Why It's Problematic:** For a student, personal projects are often the only concrete proof of your skills.

**✅ The Solution:** Create a "Personal Projects" section and describe each project with: objective, technologies used, results obtained, and GitHub/portfolio link if available.

## 9. ❌ Spelling and Grammar Errors

**The Mistake:** Spelling, grammar, or typing errors.

**Why It's Problematic:** Errors give an image of carelessness and can cause your application to be rejected.

**✅ The Solution:** Carefully proofread your CV, use a spell checker, and have it reviewed by another person.

## 10. ❌ Lack of Consistency

**The Mistake:** CV that doesn't match your LinkedIn profile, or contradictory information.

**Why It's Problematic:** Recruiters often check online profiles. Inconsistencies create distrust.

**✅ The Solution:** Ensure all your information is consistent between your CV, LinkedIn, and other professional profiles.

## Bonus: Student-Specific Mistakes

### ❌ Putting "Student" as Main Title

**✅ Better:** Use a title that reflects your skills: "Junior Web Developer" or "Digital Marketing Student".

### ❌ Hiding Lack of Experience

**✅ Better:** Highlight your education, projects, internships, and skills. Show your potential rather than hiding your lack of experience.

### ❌ Neglecting Soft Skills

**✅ Better:** Mention your interpersonal skills, adaptability, teamwork (sports, associations, group projects).
