### 3. Adapt to Job Postings

Analyze the posting and highlight the most relevant skills:

- **Read the posting carefully**: Identify the key skills mentioned

### 4. Quantify When Possible

Add concrete evidence:

- "Project Management: 10+ projects completed"
- "Python: 3 years of experience, Google certification"
- "English: TOEIC 920, international experience (6 months)"

Avoid skills that are too vague like "Creativity" without context.
